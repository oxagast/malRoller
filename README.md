# Usage

* Clone the git repo.
* Choose a decoy program, has to be .exe format.
* Copy the decoy program's .exe into the repo dir and rename it decoy.exe.
* Pick a payload, such as the rev_shell, and copy it to the repo root, renaming it payload.py.
* Edit the src of the payload.py to reflect the host and port you want to connect back to.
* Run the `build_script.bat` file.
* Now should appear a new directory named .\repacked\ with a .exe file in it.
* The file will be about 13mb to 15mb in size, plus however large the decoy.exe is.
* Locally `run nc -l -p [port] -v`.
* Social engineer your victim into running the executable in the repacked dir.
* Wait for shell!

*Enjoy!*
